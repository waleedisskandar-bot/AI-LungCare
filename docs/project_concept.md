Title: AI-Powered LungCare System

Problem Statement:
Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, and pollution-related conditions are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis is often limited by cost, accessibility, and lack of medical expertise. This project develops an AI-based system to assist in early detection and risk assessment of lung diseases using medical images, audio analysis, and lifestyle data.

Objectives:

Detect pneumonia and lung cancer using deep learning and machine learning models.

Analyze cough sounds and symptoms for respiratory risk prediction.

Integrate real-time air quality data for pollution-related health insights.

Provide an interactive, web-based diagnostic platform for users.

Proposed Approach:
The system combines multiple AI models: a CNN for pneumonia detection from X-ray images, a Random Forest and deep learning models for lung cancer risk and image classification, and a neural model for cough sound analysis. GPT-based symptom checking and air quality data from OpenWeatherMap API enhance prediction accuracy.

Expected Outcome:
A web-based intelligent system that offers accurate lung health assessments (>90% model accuracy), early disease detection, and real-time environmental health feedback to support preventive care.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC for diagnostic models; user feedback and system usability for overall performance.
