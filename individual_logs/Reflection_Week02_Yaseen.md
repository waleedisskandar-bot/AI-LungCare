1. What did I contribute this week?
I wrote the first version of our project_concept.md file, describing the problem, objectives, and AI approach. I also reviewed other team members’ sections to ensure consistent formatting.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned how Markdown files work and how important clear documentation is for future development. Team communication through MS Teams made our progress smoother.

3. What challenges did I face?
Sometimes, we had overlapping edits in GitHub, which caused merge conflicts. We solved it by assigning specific tasks to each member.

4. What will I focus on next week?
I’ll focus on designing the visual workflow diagram and helping to write the README files for each folder.
