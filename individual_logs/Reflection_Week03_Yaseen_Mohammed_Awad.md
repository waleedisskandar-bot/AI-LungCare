# Reflection Week 03 - Yaseen Mohammed Awad - B032220060

## What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
It was challenging to balance the workload among team members and align the schedule with everyoneâ€™s availability. Creating a realistic timeline that fits the project milestones required coordination.

## How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?
GitHub served as our central platform for storing and syncing project files. Teams made it easy to discuss updates, assign tasks, and share our progress. Both tools helped us stay organized and connected throughout the process.

## What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I will review the milestones and add buffer time for testing and validation to make the schedule more realistic.
