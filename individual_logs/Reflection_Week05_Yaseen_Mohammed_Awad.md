Through this activity, I learned that cost and schedule are connected.
If we delay one task, it can increase the total cost because of extra working hours.
I also noticed that using cloud GPU is useful but must be controlled to avoid waste.
Before this, I used to just focus on coding, but now I understand project planning better.
It was a good experience because it showed me how to think not only as a student, but also like someone managing a real project.
