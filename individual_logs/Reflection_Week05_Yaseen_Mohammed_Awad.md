## What was the most challenging part of building the cost plan?

The hardest part was turning our technical work into numbers. I had to think about every resource — people, hardware, and software — and calculate how much each one costs. It was new for me because I usually focus more on coding than budgeting.

## How did teamwork and communication tools help you?

Using Teams and GitHub made it easier to divide the work and make sure everyone updated their part. We discussed costs in Teams meetings and confirmed them before updating on GitHub. It saved a lot of time and made our plan more accurate.

## What tasks will you refine next week?

Next week, I will review the budget summary again after checking the schedule in Excel. I want to make sure the costs and dates match before we move to the next lab activity.
