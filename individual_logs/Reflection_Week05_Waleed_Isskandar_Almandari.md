What was the most challenging part of this lab?

The most challenging part was linking every cost to the schedule correctly. I had to make sure each task in the Excel plan matched the right budget item, and sometimes I had to adjust the hours or rates to make the total realistic. It took time to balance everything and still keep the plan simple.

How did GitHub and Excel help during the process?

GitHub helped me organize the Markdown files and keep everything in one place so my team could review it easily. Excel made it easier to calculate costs and check totals automatically. Combining both tools helped us stay consistent and avoid mistakes.

What will you work on improving next week?

Next week, I will improve the report presentation and make the tables more clear. I also plan to double-check the resource list to ensure all important software and hardware are included before we finalize the submission.
