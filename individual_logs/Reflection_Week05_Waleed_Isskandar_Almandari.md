This lab helped me understand how our team can manage time and cost better.
When we listed every resource, I was surprised how much the small things add up, like GPU hours and meetings.
It made me realize that planning is not only about finishing tasks, but also about using our time wisely.
I also learned that teamwork makes a big difference — everyone should know their responsibility and how it affects the total cost.
Doing this plan gave me a clearer picture of our project and how to stay organized until the final submission.
