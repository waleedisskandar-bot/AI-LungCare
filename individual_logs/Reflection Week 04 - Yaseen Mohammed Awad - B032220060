## What was the most challenging part of building the WBS?
The hardest part was breaking down the project into small and clear tasks that everyone could understand. It was not easy to estimate the right dates and make sure the workload was balanced between the team members.

## How did Excel and GitHub help in this process?
Excel helped in organizing all the project tasks and made the WBS look clear and easy to follow. GitHub made it simple to update and share the file so everyone could check or edit without confusion. It also helped us keep a full record of our progress.

## What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I will work on reviewing the technical parts of the project, like model training and integration, and make sure the timeline still fits the group’s progress.
