## What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
The hardest part was identifying task dependencies and deciding which activities could run in parallel. It required understanding the workflow of the project in detail.

## How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?
GitHub made version control simple and allowed the team to upload new files without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. Teams helped us coordinate meetings, share screenshots, and communicate instantly about task updates.

## What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I will work on refining the model training phase and make sure the testing phase is well aligned with our final reporting and presentation deadlines.
