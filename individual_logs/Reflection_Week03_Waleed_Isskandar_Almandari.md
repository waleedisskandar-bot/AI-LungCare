## What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
The most challenging part was defining accurate task durations and dependencies. It took time to estimate how long each activity would take and how they connected logically in the timeline.

## How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?
GitHub helped us manage files and track changes efficiently, while Microsoft Teams allowed us to communicate and share ideas instantly. We used Teams to discuss task priorities and share screenshots of the project plan for feedback.

## What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I will focus on refining the data preparation timeline and ensure all dependencies between model design and training are clearly defined.
