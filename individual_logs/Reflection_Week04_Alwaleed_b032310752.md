## What was the most challenging part of building the WBS?
The hardest part was arranging all the project activities in the correct order and phase. It took time to decide which tasks should go first and how to match them with the schedule. I also had to make sure the timeline was realistic and clear for everyone in the group.

## How did Excel and GitHub help in this process?
Excel helped a lot because it made it easy to organize tasks, owners, and dates in a clean table. GitHub allowed us to share and update the file together without losing any progress. We could see who added what and track every update easily.

## What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I plan to focus on linking the WBS with the cost and resource plan for Week 05. I will also review the timeline again to ensure all deliverables are aligned with our project milestones.
