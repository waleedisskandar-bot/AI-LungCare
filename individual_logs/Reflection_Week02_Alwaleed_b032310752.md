1. What did I contribute this week?
I created the project workflow diagram using Miro, showing how data moves from input (X-ray and cough sound) to output (diagnosis and dashboard).

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned how visual tools like Miro make it easier for everyone to understand the project structure and flow.

3. What challenges did I face?
It was challenging to combine all team ideas into one clear diagram, but after discussing, we agreed on a logical workflow.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, Iâ€™ll help in collecting datasets for the pneumonia and cough detection modules.
